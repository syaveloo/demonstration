config.json:
// ATTENTION!!! Slashes must be a "\\" or '/'. Only not '\'!!!
{
	// Your Garry`s Mod game path. By default: "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\GarrysMod"
	"gmod_path": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\GarrysMod",
	// Your images folder. By default simple example.
	"images_path": "C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\images"
}

Supported formats:
-	Program supports all images formats, this images just converting while script is executing.
-	But convert method isn`t universal, then we recommend to use JPG, JPEG, PNG, JFIF(lol, idk why in 2021 it`s so a lot of images in .jfif).
-	Program will eat only raw images, do not put in his weakness code ready .tga files. In future, maybe, i will add flags to make program universaly.
